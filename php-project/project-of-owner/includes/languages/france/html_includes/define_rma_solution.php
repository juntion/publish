And in our RMA Department, we can easily create, organize, process and track your returned orders. Once a RMA number is created, indicating that FiberStore has received your return (or exchange) orders. In FiberStore, as the RMA order moves through each stage of the fulfillment process, a Time Stamp will be logged and displayed for tracking and for future references. Reports on RMA can be generated to show which products that had the highest return rate due to defects or customer dissatisfaction. This allows us to attain deeper understanding of RMA orders and customers like you. </p>
